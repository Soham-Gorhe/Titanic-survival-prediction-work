# Titanic-survival-prediction-work

This project is all about predicting who survived the Titanic disaster using some machine learning magic. The idea was to build a model that figures out whether a passenger made it or not based on details like their age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

I used a classification approach to predict survival. First, I cleaned and prepped the data: handling missing parts, turning categories like “male” or “female” into numbers, and scaling where needed. Then, I trained a model—like a Random Forest or Logistic Regression—to learn from the data and predict outcomes.

I also tried tuning the model and playing around with different features to get better accuracy.

The model got about 81% accuracy, which means it correctly predicted survival most of the time.

It picked up on patterns like how women and children had better chances to survive.

There were some groups where the model wasn’t as confident, which gives clues on where more work could help.
